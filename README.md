NHS staff well-being and job satisfaction are crucial for delivering high-quality patient care.
Hence, this study investigates NHS staff well-being and job satisfaction through a comprehensive,
data-driven analysis. The aim is to provide understanding of the current state of NHS staff
experiences and identify the key factors influencing their well-being and job satisfaction. To
achieve this, the study has four specific objectives. Employing a quantitative research design, the
study utilises a longitudinal approach. The study draws on secondary data collected from the NHS
Staff Survey. The dataset spans from 2019 to 2023. Key preprocessing and data cleaning were
conducted using Python libraries. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) facilitates a comprehensive
examination of factors associated with NHS staff well-being. Descriptive statistics summarise key
findings. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce variables with minimal loss
of original data. Additionally, logistic regression is applied to simplify complex datasets while
ensuring robust results. Significantly, this study is grounded in two theoretical frameworks:
Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs and the Job Demand-Control Model. The findings indicate that
Acute and Community Trusts constitute the largest segment of respondents, revealing critical
insights into the determinants of job satisfaction. Recognition, organisational values, and flexible
working patterns emerged as significant factors impacting staff well-being. Through EDA and
clustering methods, the analysis identified patterns across organisational benchmark groups
based on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) scores. Cluster analysis further delineated two
primary clusters based on performance relative to PPE scores and stress levels. Following the
findings, necessary recommendations were made for NHS and further studies in the field.
